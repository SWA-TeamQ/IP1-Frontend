Why this project
----------------
This repository is a focused learning project and a polished reference for building accessible, high-quality e‑commerce UIs without frameworks. It demonstrates:
- Design tokens and a reusable UI system (spacing, shadows, button tiers)  
- Progressive enhancement: lazy-loaded Spline hero with fallback image and reduced-motion support  
- Accessibility best-practices (focus management, ARIA roles, keyboard flows)  
- Lightweight, dependency-free interactive components that are easy to read and extend

Quick start
-----------
1. Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/E-commerce-foundation/FrontEnd.git
cd FrontEnd
```
2. Open locally:
```bash
# Windows
start index.html

# macOS
open index.html
```
No build tools required.

Docs
----
- `docs/JS_ARCHITECTURE.md` — how the JS works (single entrypoint, page initializers)
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` — where things live

Recommended dev workflow
------------------------
- Branch from `main` for features: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Push branch and open a PR with screenshots / short GIF

Project structure
-----------------
- `index.html` — main entrypoint  
- `index.css` — single CSS entrypoint (imports core styles + legacy CSS)  
- `main.js` — app orchestrator loaded by all pages  
- `assets/` — images and icons  
- `core/` — shared utilities, libs, and global styles/tokens  
- `styles/` — all CSS (base, components, pages, utilities)  
- `modules/` — feature modules (products, cart, auth, admin)  
- `pages/` — standalone HTML pages (product, checkout, auth)  

Features (current)
------------------
- Responsive product grid and cards with image ratio control  
- Search with debounce, category & sort filters  
- Add to Cart, update quantity, remove items; cart drawer + checkout modal  
- Printable receipt (salePrice respected)  
- Favorites (localStorage)  
- Toast notifications with accessible ARIA attributes  
- Lazy-loaded Spline hero (performance-minded) and noscript/image fallback

Design decisions (short)
------------------------
- Design tokens in CSS (:root) for consistent spacing, typography and color.  
- Button system: primary, secondary, and icon/tertiary for clear affordances.  
- Product card ratio 4:3 to keep imagery visually dominant and consistent.  
- Spline integration: lazy-load via IntersectionObserver; provide static fallback and reduced-motion path.

Accessibility & UX checklist
----------------------------
- [x] Keyboard accessible controls for cart and modal  
- [x] Focus trap helpers and focus restore on modal/drawer close  
- [x] Toasts use `role="status"` and `aria-live` for screen reader announcements  
- [x] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected in CSS  
- [ ] Add aria-labels to any remaining interactive SVG-only buttons (ongoing review)  
- [ ] Run a full a11y audit (axe/Lighthouse) and publish results

Performance & engineering notes
-------------------------------
- Images use `loading="lazy"`; optimize (resize + WebP) before production.  
- Spline hero is lazy-loaded and injected only when near viewport to improve LCP.  
- Avoid heavy backdrop-filter/shadow on low-end devices (CSS fallbacks in place).  
- Suggested CI: GitHub Actions — run lint, unit tests (when added), and Lighthouse snapshot.

Testing & CI (recommended)
--------------------------
- Add basic unit tests for cart logic (Jest) and visual smoke tests with Playwright.  
- Add GitHub Actions workflow to run lint & tests on PRs and Lighthouse snapshots on deploy.

Contribution
------------
We welcome contributions aimed at improving the learning and production-readiness of this repo.

Suggested issues:

Appendix — Immediate improvements applied
-----------------------------------------
- Robust HTML escaping and salePrice usage in totals/receipts (prevents XSS & pricing bugs).  
- Debounced search input, toast lifecycle with class-based transitions, one-shot cart-count animation.  
- Spline viewer moved into responsive hero grid with lazy-loading placeholder and noscript fallback.  
- Focus-trap helpers wired into modals/drawer for better keyboard accessibility.

Next steps (near-term)
----------------------
- Run a full accessibility and Lighthouse audit and add badges.  
- Add optimized image assets and a short GIF demonstrating the core flow.  
- Create `docs/CHANGELOG.md` and a GitHub Actions workflow for CI.
